    <h2>Goals of this Workshop</h2>
    <ul class="list-disc m-4 flex flex-col gap-4">
      <li>Problem - What is the cause</li>
      <li>Identification - How to identify with (Angular) DevTools</li>
      <li>Resolution - How to resolve it in the Demo-App</li>
      <li>Adaption - How can we apply this to the ALI app</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

<!-- <p>
  For each problem we first need to understand it, then we will take a look on
  how to identify it and as a last point we will try to solve it
