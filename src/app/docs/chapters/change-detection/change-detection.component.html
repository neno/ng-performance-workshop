<h1>Change Detection and Re-rendering</h1>

<p>
  Change detection makes data binding in Angular just work. That's great!<br />
  By traversing the whole component tree top to bottom of your app it detects
  changes, triggers a re-render if needed and marks unused elements for garbage
  collection.<br />
  Usually change detection takes only a fraction of milliseconds per component
  instance. But if you have thousands of instances then there will not be enough
  time for re-renderings at 60 fps.<br />
  If you then have like expensive calculatons - maybe even in a loop - Angular
  will start to skip frames. The application will then start to feel laggy.
  Ideally a change detection only gets executed if really something changed.
  That is where we sometimes need to help Angular.

<h2>What triggers a change-detection cycle and/or a re-render?</h2>

<ul class="list-disc m-4">
  <li>"on"-Events, eg: click, scroll, keydown, etc.</li>
  <li>Ajax events, eg: http</li>
  <li>setTimeout, setInterval, requestAnimationFrame</li>
  <li>
    Angular wraps callbacks that trigger redundant change detection cycles
    (often 3p libs)
  </li>
  <li>
    Getters and function calls inside a template will always trigger a
    re-render.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Investigate change detections</h2>

<p>There are several ways we can investigate the change detection.</p>

<ul class="list-disc m-4">
  <li>
    Use the Profile from <strong>Angular DevTools</strong> - install Angular
    DevTools if you don't have it already.
  </li>
  <li>
    Add a <code>console.log('PokemonsListComponent')</code> inside the
    <strong>ngAfterViewChecked</strong> hook of a component and watch how many
    times it runs.
  </li>
  <li>
    Open the Chrome Source tab. Select the vendor.js file and search for
    <strong>"tick"</strong> function. Then add a logPoint like "ticked".
  </li>
  <li>
    Add <strong>enableDebugTools</strong> in main.ts when bootstrapping the App.
  </li>
</ul>

<pre class="bg-slate-800 text-white">
  <code>
    platformBrowserDynamic().bootstrapModule(AppModule)
      .then(module => enableDebugTools(module.injector.get(ApplicationRef).components[0]));
  </code>
</pre>

<h2>Resolution</h2>

<p>
  Reduce the amount of change detections and re-renderings. Ideally get rid of
  all unneeded detections and renderings.
</p>

<ul class="list-disc m-4">
  <li>
    Use the <strong>ChangeDetectionStrategy: OnPush</strong> and adapt the data
    accordingly. You can even detach components entirely from change detection
    (be careful!)
  </li>
  <li>
    Remove Getters and in template function calls. Use
    <strong>pure pipes</strong>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Do heavy lifiting up front, optimize the <strong>NgRx selectors</strong>
  </li>
  <li>Use <strong>trackBy</strong> to decrease the number of DOM mutations</li>
  <li>
    Use <strong>virtual scrolling</strong> for large lists. Currently this works
    only if the list items have the same height.
  </li>
  <li>Replace expensive <strong>@Hostlisteners</strong></li>
</ul>
