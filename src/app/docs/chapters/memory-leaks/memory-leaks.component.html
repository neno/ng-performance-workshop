<h1>Memory Leaks and Bloating</h1>

<p>This example app suffers from most performance issues and anti-patterns an Angular app can have.</p>

<h2>Performance Problems</h2>

<ul class="list-disc m-4">
  <li>
    Too many change-detection cycles and re-renderings
  </li>
  <li>
    Memory: leak or bloat
  </li>
  <li>
    Heavy computations
  </li>
  <li>
    Expensive Event Listeners
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Most of the time it is a combination of all of them.</p>
